## 🧩 Task 1: Factorial Calculator (Using Recursion)

### 🔍 Description
This task implements a program that calculates the **factorial of a given number** entered by the user.  
The solution uses a **recursive function**, handling base cases appropriately to ensure correct results for all valid inputs.

### ✨ Key Features
- Accepts integer input from the user
- Uses recursion to compute factorial
- Displays the calculated factorial clearly

## 🧮 Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using `math` Module

### 🔍 Description
This task demonstrates the use of Python’s built-in **`math` module** to perform multiple mathematical operations on a single user-provided number.

The program computes:
- Square root
- Natural logarithm
- Sine value

### ✨ Key Features
- Accepts floating-point input
- Utilizes standard mathematical functions
- Outputs multiple computed results in a readable format
