# 📝 Python Assignment: Assignment 1

## 📌 Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Factorial Calculation

**Description:**
Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program should prompt the user to enter a number and display its factorial.

---

### Task 2: Mathematical Operations

**Description:**
Create a Python program that takes a number from the user and computes:

* Square root
* Natural logarithm
* Sine value

The program should display all computed results clearly.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required for Task 1
* `math` module (standard Python library) for Task 2

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save each task in a separate `.py` file, e.g., `task1.py` and `task2.py`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the files.
4. Run the program using:

   ```bash
   python task1.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python task2.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen input prompts.
